# Statistic-Fundamental

## Type of Variable
## Probability
## Measure of Central Tendency
  * Mean = Average value
  * Median = middle value
  * Mode = Value that occurs most often
## Range
Calculate the difference by subtracting the smallest from the largest
## Variance
## Standard Deviation
## Quantile
Q0 is the smallest value in the data.

Q1 is the value separating the first quarter from the second quarter of the data.

Q2 is the middle value (median), separating the bottom from the top half.

Q3 is the value separating the third quarter from the fourth quarter

Q4 is the largest value in the data

## Skewness
## Correlation
## Checking Anomalies
## Outlier
Using IQR

IQR tells how spread the middle values are. it can be used to tell when a value is to far from the middle

An outlier is a point which fall more than 1.5 times interquartile range above third quartile or below first quartile

We will use the same dataset

Step 1 :

Arrange the data in increasing order

Calculate first (Q1) and third quartile (Q3)

Find lower bound Q1 * 1.5

Find upper bound Q3 * 1.5

Anything that lies outside of lower and upper bound is outlier
## Handling Outlier
## Handling Missing Value
  * Numeric
  * Categorical
## Inferential Statistic - Confidence Interval
## Inferential Statistic - Hypothesis Testing
Paired sample t-test :

The paired sample t-test is also called dependent sample t-test. It's an uni variate test that tests for significant difference beetween e related variable. An example of this is if you where to collect the blood pressure for an individual before and after some treatment, condition, or time point.

H0 :

means defference between two sample is 0

H1 : mean defference two sample is not 0
